# Machine-Learning-portfolio
End-to-end machine learning projects with clear problem definitions, evaluation metrics, and results-first organization.
This repository contains applied machine learning projects focused on
classification, predictive modeling, and neural networks.
Each project is organized to clearly separate:
- Problem definition
- Model development
- Results and evaluation
